# Shoe-Brand-Classification---Deep-Learning

Overview - 
This project focuses on the classification of shoe brands using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the InceptionV3 architecture. The ability to automatically identify shoe brands from images can be valuable for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, and market analysis.

Dataset - 
The dataset comprises a diverse collection of shoe images, each labeled with the corresponding brand. The dataset includes images from multiple angles, various lighting conditions, and diverse backgrounds to enhance model robustness. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to augment the dataset and improve model generalization.

Objective - 
The primary objective of the project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying shoe images into their respective brands. The model should be able to handle variations in shoe appearance, including different styles, colors, and textures, to provide reliable classification results.

Methodology - 

Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare it for model training.

Model Architecture: Two approaches are explored for model architecture:

Custom CNN: A custom CNN architecture tailored to the shoe brand classification task is designed and trained from scratch.
Transfer Learning with InceptionV3: The pre-trained InceptionV3 model, which has been trained on a large-scale image dataset, is fine-tuned for shoe brand classification to leverage its powerful feature extraction capabilities.

Model Training: The models are trained using the prepared dataset, and training hyperparameters are optimized to maximize classification accuracy.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results - 
Both the custom CNN and the InceptionV3 model demonstrate strong performance in classifying shoe brands, achieving high accuracy and robustness across different types of shoes and image variations. The InceptionV3 model, in particular, benefits from transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained features to achieve superior classification results.

Future Directions
Future directions for the project include:

Experimenting with different deep learning architectures and transfer learning strategies to further improve classification performance.
Incorporating user feedback mechanisms to continuously refine and enhance the model's accuracy and usability.
Extending the classification task to include additional attributes such as shoe type, material, or style for more comprehensive product analysis.
